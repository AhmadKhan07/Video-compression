# Video-compression

The main file contains the compression code along with its PSNR and SSIM calculation. The code is also commented for the best understanding.
The evaluation file contains source code for encoding the data set videos using XVID and H.264 codecs and then its PSNR and SSIM value calculation 
Dependencies:
To calculate the PSNR and SSIM value scikit-image library is required. To install it use the following command.
->	pip install scikit-image

A research article based on this compression approach is submitted to a research journal. The details of the article is mentioned below
“Optimizing H.264 Codec for Efficient CCTV Video Compression via Inter-frame Redundancy Reduction”. The visual computer journal.
