    "the 1st frame the upcoming frame represented as frame_N is extracted from the video stream. To find the non-redundant segment in the frame_N, frame_N\n",
    "and reference frame has been passed through a frame segmentation process to conver it into segments of desired size. In our case we used a segment size\n",
    "of 16*16. This segment size is adjustable and can be selected as per requirement of the user. A user define function \"frame_segmentor\" and \"segmentor\" \n",
    "has been used for segmenting 3D (BGR frame) and 2D frame respectively. The corresponding segments from reference_frame and frame_N are then fed into a\n",
    "difference filter to remove the common section/pixels from the frame_N segment by converting its value to 0. The result of the difference filter is\n",
    "saved in seg_diff variable. In order to remove noise from the seg_diff a threshold (pct=pixel correction threshold) has been applied to it. Any\n",
    "value below this threshold has been converted to zero to remove the noise if any exist.\n",
    "The clean seg_diff is then checked whether itâ€™s a redundant or non-redundant segment by counting its non-zero value. If the count %age is higher than\n",
    "the set threshold (missmatch_threshold), it is considered as the non-redundant segment and will be stored otherwise discarded. To store the \n",
    "non-redundant segments a empty frame (encoded_frame_segmented) of the same dimension as that of the reference frame has been created and then converted\n",
    " to segmented similar to that of refernce_frame in order to store the non-redundant segments. The index location of this segment has also been saved in \n",
    " a \".bin\" file which will be used in the reconstruction of frames in decoding process. This process will continue untill all the segment in the\n",

    " 1st a video object has been created \"v_enc=cv.VideoWriter()\" and then the output frame is stored in it using \"v_enc.write(output_frame)\" command.\n",
    " If a whole frame is redundant then a specil code (255 0) has been added to .bin file indicating that in the reconstruction process the reference_frame\n",
